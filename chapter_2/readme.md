### Explain the process for finding the path with your graphical file browser.

First I would `click` on and open finder via the finder icon in my dock.

Then I would scroll down to my home directory which is 'ryansmyth'.

I would `click` on 'ryansmyth' to show the contents of my home directory.

Then `click` on and open the 'workspace' folder. Which would show the contents of this folder.

Then `click` on and open the 'davinci_coders_t2_2015' folder to show its contents.

Then `click` on and open the 'homework' folder which shows its contents.

Then `click` on and open the 'learn_command_line_exercises' folder which shows its contents.

Then `click` on and open the 'chapter_2' folder. which would graphically take me to my current path of:

'/Users/ryansmyth/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_2'
