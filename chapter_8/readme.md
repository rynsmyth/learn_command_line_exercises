### Explain what directories were visted using `pushd` and `popd`

Using the `pushd` and `popd` commands in my directory path `tmp/stuff/things/frank/joe/alex/john`.

I first used `pushd` to navagate to `tmp/stuff/things/frank`. Then I used `popd` to return to my `tmp` directory.

Then  I `$cd stuff`, then I `$pushd things/frank/joe` and then used `popd` to return to my `stuff` directory.
