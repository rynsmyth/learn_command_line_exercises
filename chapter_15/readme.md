# Do More

###Create some more index cards for memorizing these three symbols. Write the symbol on one side, then what it does on the other side. Drill these just like the other commands.

I created flashcards for the following commands:

`$|$`

`$<$`

`$>$`

`$>>$`

# Alternative "english" ways of asking for pipes and redirection:

### Can you put "This class is fun" into bar.txt?

`$echo "This class is fun" >> bar.txt`

### Can you put "Oh so much fun" into foo.txt?

`$echo "Oh so much fun" >> foo.txt`
